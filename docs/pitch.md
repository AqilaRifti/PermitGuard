# PermitGuard - Pitch

## 🎯 The Problem

**Web3 users are blind to their wallet's exposure.**

Every time you connect to a dApp, you grant permissions. Over time, these accumulate into a tangled web of access rights that most users:
- Don't know exist
- Can't easily find
- Have no simple way to revoke

**The result?** Wallets remain connected to abandoned projects, compromised protocols, and forgotten dApps—each one a potential attack vector.

---

## 💡 The Solution

**PermitGuard** - A single-page app that gives users complete visibility and control over their wallet permissions.

### One Dashboard. Total Control.

- **See Everything** - All dApps with active permissions in one view
- **Understand Risk** - Color-coded risk levels (safe/moderate/dangerous)
- **Act Fast** - One-click revocation for individual or bulk permissions
- **Track History** - Timeline of all permission events

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters

### For Users
- **Security** - Identify and revoke risky permissions before they're exploited
- **Awareness** - Finally understand what access you've granted
- **Control** - Take back ownership of your wallet's permissions

### For the Ecosystem
- **Trust** - Users who feel in control are more confident in Web3
- **Education** - Visual risk indicators teach users about permission types
- **Standards** - Promotes best practices for dApp permission management
